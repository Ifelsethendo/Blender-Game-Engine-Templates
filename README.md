# Blender-Game-Engine-Templates
Blender Game Engine Game Type Templates 
Logic Bricks (and Python script) based Game Templates for Blender, keeping it as simple as possible while also adding enough action to be interesting.

**3rd_Person_follow_camera_01**
Camera follows the cube around a little maze in a third person fashion.

**breakout_like**
It's like the classic Breakout game, mouse controls the paddle.

**CUBE_INVADERS**
Evil invader cubes are coming for you, shoot 'em all before it's too late.
Features a ping ponging  spawenr for for a very that has a Centipede feel to it.

**Dodge_Tunnel**
Object spawn in the distance and speed your way, dodge or die! Well there's no death, just bumping in this simulation.

**FPS+Enemies+WallRun**
First person shooter, with enemies, wall running/climbing and jumping

**MakeHumanLady_walkin**
A simple MakeHuman model with a imported BVH walk cycle, 

**Mouse_Tracker_01**
Click the mouse to drag the tracker object around the plane

**Mouse_Tracker_Grid**
Click the mouse to position the tracker object somewhere on the grid, drop some cubes on the spot

**Mouse_Tracker_RTS**
Click the mouse to position the Goto target for the RTS Unit to travel to 

**path_to_scripts**
Get the path to the scripts folder using the OS python module

**Pits_Vines_Ladders**
Like Activision Pitfall but even lower resolution, and yet 3D!
This version has no crocodiles, scorpions, tarpits, spiders or fires, maybe sometime soon.

**pong**
Knock around a ball with a pair of paddles in this solo or two player game.

**Rotation_Shooter**
Your ship spins, the enemies spin, it's the whirling wonder fun you've always wanted!
Another Ping-ponging spawner in this one. Some bugs too.

**SideScroll_Shooter**
You 'fly' toward the right where the endless enemies are spawning. Sound familiar?

**Sigils_01**
Kind of like a sprite sheet for magic sigils, space bar changes the UV coordinates to reveal a new magic symbol

**Sigils_02**
Kind of like a sprite sheet for magic sigils, space bar changes the UV coordinates to reveal a new magic symbol

**Simple_Player_Maze**
Simple example of a player moving around a 3D maze from the top down 2D-ish point of view.

**Simple_Player_Maze_Waypoints**
Simple example of a player moving around a 3D maze from the top down 2D-ish point of view.
But now the 'enemies' follow waypoints around the map. The default Seek behavior for chasing the player 
was awful for running a maze so I gave the enemy cubes some patrols to run.
I'd like a better way to do this, perhaps procedural grid creation of the map, then number the plains that make each sector.
Or maybe a curve object, get the vertices and lay the waypoints at each vertice....

**TextReader_filepath**
Read text from a file in the same directory as the blend file, store it in an list and then display the text line by line.

**TextReader_textBlock**
Read text from a a text block stored in the blend file, store it in an list and then display the text line by line.

**TextScroll2**
Like a famouse movie or nine.

**TrenchRun_Torus_IV**
Many Bothans died for this demo. 
I was having major stuttering issues spawning new trench parts every x seconds, so I went for the Wheel of Misfortune!
